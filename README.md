The [**Allthings Egypt**](https://letterboxd.com/prog_jacob/list/allthings-egypt/) list gathers <b>Egyptian films</b> as well as <b>international productions</b> that feature Egypt as a setting, subject, or part of the narrative. It is organized <em>chronologically by <b>release date</b></em>, from the oldest to the newest, to provide a sense of how Egyptâ€™s representation in cinema has evolved over time.

## &#128680; Help Needed: 1,000 More Films to Add! &#128680;

There is an additional <b>list of 4,700 movies</b>, which I estimate contains around <b>1,000 films not yet included here</b>. However, there's <b>no reliable way to import them</b> because they lack their <b>original titles</b>. To fix this, I need help verifying and retrieving these missing titles. Anyone can <b>anonymously contribute</b> by adding a movie or two to this ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UD2LSrXbXFD8ttaELjEe_JtkTwyVUyZm1sadbZDgoRA/edit?usp=sharing"><b>Google Sheet</b></a> ðŸ‘ˆ.

## About this Project

This repository contains the scripts and data used to compile the [**Allthings Egypt**](https://letterboxd.com/prog_jacob/list/allthings-egypt/) movie list, which aims to be the most comprehensive collection of films related to Egypt. The scripts are not part of a structured project but rather a collection of useful tools for gathering, processing, and cross-referencing movie data from different sources such as IMDb, TMDb, and Letterboxd.

## Data Files

This repository includes several datasets, each representing movie lists from different sources:

- [**`Letterboxd Dataset`**](./data/letterboxd-url-1to4746.csv) â€“ A list of [**Letterboxd**](https://letterboxd.com/films/country/egypt/) movie URLs.
- [**`IMDb Dataset`**](./data/imdb-mix-1to6396.csv) â€“ A collection of movies scraped from [**IMDb**](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature,tv_series,short,tv_miniseries,tv_movie,tv_special,tv_short,video&countries=EG&sort=release_date,asc).
- [**`TMDb Dataset (Movies)`**](./data/tmdb-mix-1to4261.csv) â€“ A dataset containing movies from [**TMDb**](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/discover-movie).
- [**`TMDb Dataset (TV Shows)`**](./data/tmdb-mix-1to1147.csv) â€“ A dataset containing TV shows from [**TMDb**](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/discover-tv).
- [**`Allthings Egypt List`**](./data/allthings-egypt.csv) â€“ The primary dataset compiling all relevant films related to Egypt.

## Usage

To use, run `python run.py --help`:

```bash
usage: run.py [-h] {convert-franco,is-franco,cross-check,tmdb-api,LLM} ...

Experiments and Configuration for the Allthings Egypt Project.

positional arguments:
  {convert-franco,is-franco,cross-check,tmdb-api,LLM}
                        Specify which script to run.
    convert-franco      Convert Franco movie titles to their Arabic counterparts.
    is-franco           Check whether movie titles are in Franco or Arabic (responds with NO) or not (responds with YES).
    cross-check         Find movies in the destination CSV file, which the host CSV file doesn't contain.
    tmdb-api            Discover Egyptian movies or TV shows or search form them in the TMDB API.
    LLM                 Ask the running local LLM server any number of questions.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

To use the CSV utility functions, run `python utils.py --help`:

```bash
SYNOPSIS
    utils.py COMMAND

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     save
       Saves a list of dictionaries to a CSV file.

     load
       Loads a CSV file into a list of dictionaries.

     deduplicate
       Deduplicates a CSV file rows by a given key in place.

     take-columns
       Takes only the specified columns from a CSV file in a new file.

     numerize-column
       Converts a CSV file column to integers in place.
```

## Available Scripts

### Data Collection

- **`fetch_tmdb.py`** â€“ Fetches all movies or TV shows from the TMDb API. Requires an API key set in a `.env` file as `TMDB_API_KEY=Your-Free-Api-Key-Here`.

- **`scrapers/imdb.js`** â€“ Contains functions meant to run in the browser console of IMDb pages. These include:

  - `clickLoadMore(N)`: Clicks the "Load More" button `N` times.
  - Code blocks to parse movie data and copy the resulting CSV rows to the clipboard.

- **`scrapers/letterboxd.js`** â€“ Provides a similar tool for extracting movie data from Letterboxd. Currently, scraping must be done page by page manually.

### Data Processing

- **`cross_check.py`** â€“ Compares a **destination list** (CSV file) with a **host list** to identify missing movies.
- **`utils.py`** â€“ A set of helper functions for CSV manipulation, including `loading` and `saving` files, `deduplicating` rows given a reference column, and `extracting` columns to a new CSV file.

### Additional Utilities

- **`fuzzydict.py`** â€“ A custom dictionary class that extends Pythonâ€™s `dict`. The `get()` method returns the closest matching key based on edit distance, useful for handling inconsistencies in movie titles.
- **`convert_franco.py`** - A work in progress as an attempt to convert the **Franco** titles to their original titles using an LLM.
